# java-postgres-demo
This is a simple java project demonstrating postgres connectivity with jdbc 
(It is an intellij idea project)




# installation (under Intellij IDEA)
You'll need to download a postgresql jar into `ext-jars` and then add it as a module in module settings (right click on your project name, and choose module settings).

In more advanced projects, you'll find a maven or gradle project configuration that takes care of downloading such dependencies for you.
